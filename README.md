# DL-Foundation-from-Scratch
Stanford Lecture - CS231n theory implementation using NumPy for deep learning fundamentals

## 1. k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Implementation
Implemented a complete k-NN classifier from scratch using NumPy.

* **Vectorization:** optimized performance by replacing nested loops with matrix operations (Broadcasting), achieving significant speedup.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conducted K-fold cross-validation to find the optimal $k$.
* **Modules:**
    * `k_nn_utils.py`: Core logic for distance calculation (L2) and prediction.
    * `knn_cifar10.py`: Script for training, testing, and visualization.

## 🔬 Experiment & Analysis: Limitations of k-NN
### Hypothesis & Experiment
Investigated the relationship between dataset size and model performance to verify the effectiveness of Pixel-wise L2 distance in high-dimensional space (CIFAR-10).
* **Setup:** Compared accuracy between small dataset ($N=5,000$) and full dataset ($N=50,000$).
* **Result:** Accuracy saturated around **33%** despite a 10x increase in data.

### Key Insights
**1. The Curse of Dimensionality**
Even with 50,000 samples, the data remains sparse in the 3,072-dimensional space. The distance to the nearest neighbor does not decrease significantly, leading to diminishing returns in performance (Logarithmic growth).

**2. Semantic Gap in L2 Distance**
* **Observation:** The model often misclassifies images based on dominant background colors rather than object shapes.
* **Analysis:** L2 distance calculates the sum of independent pixel differences. It is sensitive to **global color distributions** (e.g., green background) but fails to capture **local semantic features** (e.g., edges, shapes).
* **Conclusion:** Pure data scaling cannot overcome the structural limitations of pixel-based distance metrics. This necessitates the use of feature-extraction-based models like Linear Classifiers or CNNs.
